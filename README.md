# RL_state_preparation

This repository contains the code for state preparation in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02157.

Totally five algorithms are considered: stochastic gradient descent, Krotov algorithms, Q-learning (QL), deep Q-learning (DQL) and policy gradient (PG). All algorithms here are in general optimizing the final fidelity of state preparation

The repository is divided to two subrepositories
1. preparation of single qubit state
2. preparation of multiqubit state (spin transfer)
